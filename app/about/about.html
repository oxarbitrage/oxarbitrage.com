      <p>Open source code hacker and blockchain enthusiast.</p>

      <p>I started the coding formally for a living 15 years ago, self educated and highly motivated, the passion for computers and technology made me learn what was needed, then the real world fine tuned the coding to be effective and fast problem solver.</p>

      <p>Seduced the the financial electronic markets i started to code trading strategies and learning all i can in the field of market engine technologies several years ago.</p>

      <p>Defrauded on how financial system works i moved on. In the last years, with the irruption of blockchain technology i found the perfect spot to develop. This new way of funding projects is simply much more better than what we had, the transparency is so much needed, the privacy, the freedom among a huge amounts of other features this technology is bringing simply fits perfect with my lifestyle and way of think and work. </p>

      <p>Oxarbitrage sympathize with all kind of projects that can assure freedom and elevate humankind to a new, better era.</p>

      <p>I belive in open source development and for that reason i prefer working with the open source community, with the most permissive licences(MIT). I like to contribute my buggy code with others as i used others so many times in the past, now is time to give back something. </p>

      <p>In the future i see myself making my own dreams came true by developing futuristic software that contributes to humanity as a whole.</p>

      <p>oxarbitrage logo is from the japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, is the logo used by a character named "Laughing Man", an expert hacker that use the logo to hide himself on video camara.</p>
      <p>I really like the series and the logo too, it is an icon of cyberpunk culture(like the A in a circle), no other special reason for using it.</p>
